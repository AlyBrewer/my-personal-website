# Personal Website/Portfolio Project (part 2)
(Using React and Vite :) )

This is a project I'm working on to replace my current personal website (currently active [here!](alybrewer.com)).

I have a lot of goals and it's not quite ready yet, so be sure to check back periodically to see what I'm up to.
